## Project Scope
Healthcare Bluebook "HCBB" provides cost comparison information about health care procedures to consumers to help them gind the most cost effective way for treatments they need. Two executives from HCBB presented background information to our class, provided several large sets of data, and asked three questions. Our team tackled answering the second question:  
##### 1. Which procedures (HCPCS codes) had the largest change in average payment between 2015 and 2017?  
##### 2. Which codes had the largest change in utilization?

 Those seemed like simple enough questions until diving into the very messy data!
